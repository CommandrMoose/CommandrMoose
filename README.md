Software Developer and Game Developer.

* Pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Games Design at QUT (3rd and Final Year!)
* I have a passion for quirky games and projects
* I'm always wanting to learn and improve my skillset.
* Love movies, but I've probably not seen what you're talking about (looking to improve that!)
